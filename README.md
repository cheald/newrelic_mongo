# The newrelic_mongo gem

The `newrelic_mongo` gem contains NewRelic RPM instrumentation for the
mongo-ruby-driver gem, contributed by the community of RPM users.  It requires
the RPM Agent to run.

The gem was forked from the deprecated `rpm_contrib` gem and is maintained by
Raphael Crawford-Marks.

If you are using Mongoid 3 and/or Moped, please use the `newrelic_moped` gem:
